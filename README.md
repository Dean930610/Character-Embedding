# Character-Embedding
#### This section mainly focuses on how to generate a character based word embedding based on Bi-LSTM based model. The word embedding model will be used as the target of Bi-LSTM. The last hidden state of LSTM will be extracted as the character embedding vectors of input words.
#### Character embedding can be used in many NLP practical works as one type of input embedding for improving the performance of the algorithms. There are many data pre-processing approaches used which has been defined in the previous
